Recently, a bank with millions of customers has noticed unusual number of customers leaving the bank. To make sure that this negative development will be stopped on time, the bank rest needs to identify the customers who have high likelihood to churn. Identifying these customers will help the bank also to avoid repeating the same mistakes with the rest of the customers and avoid them leaving the bank from the early stages. In our analysis, we aim to predict the churning rate of the customers from the bank. From the millions of customers, we have randomly selected 10K customers. We will use customer's characteristics to determine his/her probability of leaving the bank. To learn about bank's customers, we will make use of one of the Deep Learning techniques, the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Moreover, we will use popular Python libraries such as Tensorow, Keras and Machine Learning techniques such as Adam Optimizer to train the ANN model and predict the churn rates.
